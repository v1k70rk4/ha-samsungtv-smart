# HomeAssistant - SamsungTV Smart Component

## ***Enable SmartThings*** - Setup instructions

### Create personal access token

1. Log into the [personal access tokens page](https://account.smartthings.com/tokens) and click '[Generate new token](https://account.smartthings.com/tokens/new)'
2. Enter a token name (can be whatever you want), for example, 'Home Assistant' and select the following authorized scopes:
    - Devices (all)
    - Installed Apps (all)
    - Locations (all)
    - Apps (all)
    - Schedules (all)
    - Scenes (all)
3. Click 'Generate token'. When the token is displayed, copy and save it somewhere safe (such as your keystore) as you will not be able to retrieve it again.

### Configure Home Assistant

Once the SmartThings token has been generated, you need to configure the component with it in order to make it work as explained in the main guide.

**Note:** if the component has been already configured for your TV, you must delete it from the HA web interface and then re-configure it to enable SmartThings integration.<br/>

#### SmartThings Device ID

If during configuration flow automatic detection of SmartThings device ID fails, a new configuration page will open requesting you to manual
insert it.
To identify your TV device ID use the following steps:

- Go [here](https://my.smartthings.com/advanced/devices) and login with your SmartThings credential
- Click on the name of your TV from the list of available devices
- In the new page search the column called `Device ID`
- Copy the value (is a UUID code) and paste it in the HomeAssistant configuration page
